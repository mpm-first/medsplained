          <p>We have been providing this service for our loved ones for over a decade. Whether explaining new medications, proposed surgeries, or life-long illnesses; breaking down the science to help people understand their health is a passion that fuels us. Recently we felt that people should not be required to have family or friends in medicine to enjoy these benefits. Collaboration with family and friends led to the development of Medsplained. We look forward to contributing to your healthcare story and show you the benefits of having a “doctor in the family.”</p>
